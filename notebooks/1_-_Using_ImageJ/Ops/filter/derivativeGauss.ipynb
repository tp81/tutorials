    "Let's say that we want to find the distance between each of the rings to determine the rate of growth of this tree. If we just found the local minimums across the x-dimension we could find the distance between rings in most scenarios but small cracks in the wood as well as the region outside the wood could provide bad data. To work around this we can use the second partial derivative along the radius of the wood (the x-dimension in our case) to find the ring locations more accurately."
