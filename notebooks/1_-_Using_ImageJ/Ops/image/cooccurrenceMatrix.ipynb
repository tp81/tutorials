    "Note the parameters here:\n",
    "* `IterableInterval in`: the input image\n",
    "* `int nrGreyLevels`: the number of different data values within the values, used to compute the size of the output (where the output is a `double[nrGreyLevels][nrGreyLevels]`). For example, if your image is of `UnsignedByteType` and you know that every value in the range [0, 127] exists within the image then `nrGreyLevels` is `128`. However if you know the data only ranges from [0,72] then you can input `nrGreyLevels` as 73, saving memory. \n",
    "* `int distance`: the magnitude of the offeset from the current data location that you want to check for cooccurrence. For example, if we want to create a cooccurrence matrix of every data location `p`, located at `[x, y]` and the pixel diagonally offset from `p` at a distance of `[d0, d1]`, the `Op` will check pixels `p` and the pixel at location `[x + d0, y + d1]` for all pixels on the image. Each value of `orientation` is mutliplied by `distance` to determine that offset `[d0, d1]`.\n",
    "* `MatrixOrientation orientation`: denotes the **direction** on which to travel to find the offset pixel. There are separate `MatrixOrientation` classes for two- and three-dimensional cooccurrence matrices, and each have enums denoting the most common offsets, although you can still create a new MatrixOrientation2D or 3D with your own `[d0, d1(, d2)]` if you so choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the output `double[]` contains the **percentage** of pairs that follow that pattern, not the **number** of pairs.\n",

    "This equation assigns two data locations that are horizontal neighbors with the maximum value of the type (where the modulus is 1 and 2), followed by an \"off\" pixel (where the modulus is 0). This works out well for cooccurrence between a data location at location `[x, y]` and a data location at location `[x + 1, y + 1]`. We should then expect to see large (equilavlent, to be precise) percentages of 1 and 1, 0 and 1, and 1 and 0 respectively, however no values of 0 and 0 respectively, since there are no data locations with a value of zero that also have a zero as a horizontal neighbor in this image."
